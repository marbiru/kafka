"Sin always comes in the open, and available to the senses. It walks on its roots, and need not be torn from the ground.",
"There can be knowledge of evil without believing in it, because there is no more evil than already exists.",
"Only here is suffering suffering. Not because those who suffer in this world will receive anything in the next, but because in that world Suffering (unchanged and only freed from its opposite) is bliss.",
"The joys of this life are not its own, but our fear of rising to a higher life; the suffering of this life is not its own, but our self-affliction because of that fear.",
"Death hangs before us, much like a painting of Alexander the Great on the schoolroom wall. What we must do, by our actions, is to darken (or even efface) the picture in our lifetimes.",
